Working sample code for a Profound.js application that consumes a web service and then both displays the resulting data on screen using the Profound UI Rich Display and saves the data to a DB2 table on an IBM i using the Profound.js connector.

## Requirements

- Node.js and Profound.js installed either on a PC or IBM i
- An IBM i

## Installation

Follow these instructions to produce a working app.

### Profound.js

- Install Node.js and Profound.js.  This can be done on either a PC or IBM i.
- Clone this repository to a subfolder in the Profound.js `modules` folder.
- Using the included `config.js` as a guide
  - Add an entry for the new module in the `initialModules` section of the `config.js` file in the root Profound.js folder.
  - Adjust the `pathlist` property in `config.js` in the root Profound.js folder, using the included `config.js` as a guide. The pathlist should contain both the sample web service module as well as the sample data library that will be created on the IBM i (if they both have the same name, only one pathlist entry is needed).

### IBM i

- Create a library to contain your sample data, making sure that the library name is included in the `pathlist` property defined in the previous section.
- Create the exchangep table by executing the included `exchangep.sql` script.  Be sure to edit the scripts to contain your own library name.  SQL scripts can be run either from IBM Access Client Solutions on your PC or by issuing a statement on the IBM i like

```
> RUNSQLSTM SRCSTMF('QSQLSRC/EXCHANGEP.sql') COMMIT(*NONE) NAMING(*SQL)
```

## Running the app

- If Profound.js is installed on the IBM i:
  - If the server was already running you will need to restart it to apply the config file changes
  ```ENDTCPSVR SERVER(*PJS) INSTANCE(PROFOUNDJS)```
  - Start the server
  ```STRTCPSVR SERVER(*PJS) INSTANCE(PROFOUNDJS)```

- If Profound.js is installed on a PC
  - Start the web service from command line by setting your current directory to the Profound.js directory, then issuing this command.
  ```shell
  node start.js
  ```

Point your browser to
```http://[SERVER NAME]:[PORT]/exchange```


## Sample code

The sample code provided is a simple example of consuming a web service from Profound.js and then updating a DB2 table on the IBM i.


The program pulls data from a stock exchange web service and displays the current rates on the screen. It also saves those rates to the table, adding then if they donâ€™t exist or updating them if they do.
