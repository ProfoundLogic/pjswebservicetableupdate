Working sample code for a Profound.js application that consumes a web service and then both displays the resulting data on screen using the Profound UI Rich Display and saves the data to a DB2 table on an IBM i using the Profound.js connector.

## Requirements

- Node.js and Profound.js installed either on a PC or IBM i
- An IBM i

## Installation

Follow these instructions to produce a working app.

### Profound.js

- Install Node.js and Profound.js.  This can be done on either a PC or IBM i.
- Clone this repository to a subfolder in the Profound.js `modules` folder.
- Using the included `config.js` as a guide
  - Add an entry for the new module in the `initialModules` section of the `config.js` file in the root Profound.js folder.
  - Adjust the `pathlist` property in `config.js` in the root Profound.js folder, using the included `config.js` as a guide. The pathlist should contain both the sample web service module as well as the sample data library that will be created on the IBM i (if they both have the same name, only one pathlist entry is needed).

### IBM i

- Create a library to contain your sample data, making sure that the library name is included in the `pathlist` property defined in the previous section.
- Create the exchangep table by executing the included `exchangep.sql` script.  Be sure to edit the scripts to contain your own library name.  SQL scripts can be run either from IBM Access Client Solutions on your PC or by issuing a statement on the IBM i like

```
> RUNSQLSTM SRCSTMF('QSQLSRC/EXCHANGEP.sql') COMMIT(*NONE) NAMING(*SQL)
```

## Running the app

- If Profound.js is installed on the IBM i:
  - If the server was already running you will need to restart it to apply the config file changes
  ```ENDTCPSVR SERVER(*PJS) INSTANCE(PROFOUNDJS)```
  - Start the server
  ```STRTCPSVR SERVER(*PJS) INSTANCE(PROFOUNDJS)```

- If Profound.js is installed on a PC
  - Start the web service from command line by setting your current directory to the Profound.js directory, then issuing this command.
  ```shell
  node start.js
  ```

Point your browser to
```http://[SERVER NAME]:[PORT]/exchange```


## Sample code

The sample code provided is a simple example of consuming a web service from Profound.js and then updating a DB2 table on the IBM i.


The program pulls data from a stock exchange web service and displays the current rates on the screen. It also saves those rates to the table, adding then if they don’t exist or updating them if they do.
